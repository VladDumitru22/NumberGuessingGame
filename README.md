Gameplay Instructions

The program will generate a random number within a default range (e.g., 1 to 100).
The user inputs their guess.
The program provides feedback:
"Too high" if the guess is greater than the random number.
"Too low" if the guess is less than the random number.
"Correct" if the guess matches the random number.
The game ends when the user guesses the number correctly, and the total number of attempts is displayed.
